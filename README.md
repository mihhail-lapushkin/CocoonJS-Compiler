# About

This is a Java tool that I've created for my [HTML mobile game project](https://github.com/mihhail-lapushkin/Ancient-Riddle). It optimizes and merges all JavaScript and removes development stuff making the project ready to be deployed to [CocoonJS](http://www.ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs). Feel free to browse the code to see how it works :)
